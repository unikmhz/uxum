An opinionated backend service framework based on axum.

## Project goals

 * Minimum boilerplate code.
 * Minimal performance impact from features not in use.
 * Metrics, tracing, OpenAPI and common service support features available out of the box.
 * Ready to be deployed on a local server, VM or container, or in the cloud.

## Project non-goals

 * Performance and feature parity with bare axum.
   Straight-up axum without all bells and whistles provided by this framework will always be a bit faster
   and more flexible.
 * Database access layers and connection pools.
   This is out of scope for this project.

## Supported crate features

 * `grpc`: support nesting Tonic GRPC services inside Axum server instance.
 * `kafka`: support writing logs to a Kafka topic.
 * `systemd`: enable systemd integration for service notifications and watchdog support (Linux only).
